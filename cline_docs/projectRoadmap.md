# Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A flexible document automation system that generates personalized investment recommendations based on natural language user intents. The system processes various formats of user intent text files, intelligently matches providers and platforms across multiple organizations, and generates tailored recommendations considering client profiles and available investment options.

## High-Level Goals
- [ ] Generic Intent Processing System
  - [ ] Natural Language Understanding
    - Support various intent phrasings
    - Extract key information (providers, preferences)
    - Handle ambiguous requests
    - Use the LLM provider to further enhance intent and to create recommendations
  - [ ] Provider/Platform Matching
    - Fuzzy matching for provider names
    - Platform capability comparison
    - Risk profile interpretation

- [ ] Flexible Data Integration
  - [ ] Multi-Client Support
    - Dynamic client data loading
    - Profile-based risk assessment
    - Multiple pension plan handling
  - [ ] Multi-Organization Processing
    - Platform comparison logic
    - Portfolio matching system
    - Fee structure analysis
  - [ ] Investment Matching
    - Risk profile alignment
    - Portfolio recommendation logic
    - Fee optimization

- [ ] Dynamic Document Generation
  - [ ] Template System
    - Generic placeholder handling
    - Dynamic section generation
    - Format preservation
  - [ ] Content Generation
    - Context-aware recommendations
    - Provider-specific details
    - Risk-appropriate suggestions
  - [ ] Quality Assurance
    - Content validation
    - Format verification
    - Data accuracy checks

- [ ] Robust System Integration
  - [ ] REST API
    - Generic file handling
    - Validation framework
    - Error management
  - [ ] Process Orchestration
    - Workflow management
    - State handling
    - Error recovery

## Completion Criteria
