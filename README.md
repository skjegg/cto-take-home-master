# Automwrite Take-Home Assessment

Please find a copy of the assessment in this folder, along with all relevant input files (`userintent.txt`, `client.json`, `organisation.json`, and the template `.docx`). The exercise is to provide a `.docx` output that is client-presentable.

## Overview
REST API that processes user intent from a `.txt` file, integrates it with data from JSON files, and outputs a formatted `.docx` document using the provided template.

## Requirements
- Java 17
- Apache POI
- Spring Boot
- Claude API key (optional for LLM-based processing)

## Input Files (found in the resources folder)
- `userintent.txt`: Contains the user's intent to be processed.
- `client.json`: Represents information about a client.
- `organisation.json`: Represents information about the organisation and possible outcomes.
- Template `.docx`: A Word document template where the processed user intent will be inserted.

## Task
1. Parse the `userintent.txt` file to extract the user's intent.
2. Parse `client.json` and `organisation.json` into objects.
3. Process the user intent and map it to the client and organisation details.
4. Optionally use the LLM service to refine or transform the text.
5. Insert the processed text into the relevant section of the provided `.docx` template.
6. Save the output as a new `.docx` file.

Feel free to use your own equivalent JSONS or intent .txt files if of equivalent complexity should you find this preferable. 

## API Endpoint

POST /api/user-request Body: multipart/form-data

userIntent (file): The .txt file containing user intent.
template (file): The .docx template file.


## Examples
